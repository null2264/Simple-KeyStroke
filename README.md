# Simple-KeyStroke

Simple KeyStroke displayer. Messy but will do for now, can't find any that works for Linux so i thought... "FINE I'LL DO IT MYSELF".

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard) (Python Module)
- [PyQT](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt)

## Usage
Simply run it with command
```
python keystroke.py
```
or
```
python3 keystroke.py
```
If you're using Linux, it's required sudo privileged.
```
sudo python keystroke.py
```
or
```
sudo python3 keystroke.py
```

## Plan
- Add Mouse click indicators (LMB and RMB)
- Add different theme
- Add key changer (if possible)
- Clean up
- Compile to executable (maybe)
